# Javascript C Lexer and Parser
The following project provides a lexer and parser for checking given C input syntactically and grammatically.

* Lexer for C11 Standard
* Lexes and parses preprocessor statements
* Preprocessor does not parse constant-expressions like stated in the standard
* Prints out debug messages with the currently matched rule

Dependencies:
* Lexer and Parser are generated by jison
* returns a AST of the parsed input
* use ```Makefile``` to create AMD js


## Parser

###EBNF
Jison supports now the parsing of the EBNF Grammar and therefor it would be possible to use the 
c++0x-Standard from here http://www.nongnu.org/hcb/#header-name

More information about EBNF support can be found here: https://gist.github.com/zaach/1659274

Quiz
=======
The quiz itself can be found in its sub dir. See writing.md for more information about using it.
It relies on bootstrap, KaTeX (for TeX-support) and CodeMirror for the code editor.
